[Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) is a simpler and more privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics.

Collecting information on the internet is important, but it’s broken. We’ve become complacent in trading information for free access to web services, and then complaining when those web services do crappy things with that data.

The problem is this: _if we aren’t paying for the product, we are the product_.

Google Analytics may give you free access to their services but in turn, they’re assembling data profiles on your website visitors, which they can then use for better targeting of advertisements across their network.

We need to stop giving away our data and our users' privacy for free access to a tool.

Fathom respects the privacy of your users and does not collect any personally identifiable information. All while giving you the information you need about your site, so you can make smarter decisions about your design and content.

At present, Fathom Analytics Lite is not PECR compliant due to the fact that it uses an anonymous cookie. Our [PRO version](https://usefathom.com) is PECR compliant, and we'll be making changes to this codebase some time in the future to make it compliant.
