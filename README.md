# Fathom â€“ Simple Website Analytics

**This is a fork of [Fathom v1](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) with bug fixes and improvements.**

Fathom is a website analytics tool which respects the privacy of your users and doesn't collect any personally identifiable information. All while giving you the information you need about your site, so you can make smarter decisions about your design and content.
